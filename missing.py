# The point of this script is to take a giant list of names from some source
# file, check which names do not have an entry on one language's Wikipedia,
# and then spit out that resultant set to a file. The command-line options let
# you specify the wiki to check and the filenames to read and write.

# Please add your name to the User-Agent in the headers dict in DEFAULT_HEADERS.

# Note: to find out who actually did have an entry on the wiki, do a simple set
# operation for difference between the original namelist and the file that
# comes out at the end.
